# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hindsight Forensic Workflow

This repository provides a modular, fully automated forensic analysis pipeline designed for use with **CrowdStrike Falcon Real Time Response (RTR)**. It leverages **Hindsight**, an open-source browser artifact parser, to extract, convert, and collect browser history from remote Windows endpoints ‚Äî with real-time visibility via **Slack alerts**.

Ideal for:
- Digital forensic analysts conducting targeted history captures
- SOC engineers building adaptive incident response playbooks
- Threat hunters pivoting off browser-based behavior

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Overview

This workflow is composed of six tightly integrated phases:

1. **Platform Validation**  
   - Automatically validates that the targeted device is online and running **Windows OS**
   - Gathers hostname, platform type, and available tags from Falcon API

2. **Tool Deployment**  
   - Dynamically sets a custom working directory on the remote device (e.g., `C:\hindsight`)  
   - Securely uploads `hindsight.exe` to that folder via RTR's **Put File**  
   - Prepares any supporting environment variables or folders

3. **Browser Artifact Extraction**  
   - Executes a custom PowerShell script (`hindsight-processing.ps1`) on the endpoint  
   - Extracts browser artifacts (Chrome, Edge, Brave) and converts to the chosen format:  
     - `.xlsx` for easy analysis  
     - `.jsonl` for structured parsing  
     - `.sqlite` for raw queryability  
   - Captures the browser profile names in use (for context)

4. **Resilient Polling & Collection Loop**  
   - Starts a **15-minute polling loop** (15 total attempts, 1 min max intervals)  
   - If extraction succeeds: retrieves a ZIP archive of results  
   - If a script exception occurs: Slack is notified, and retry logic is activated  
   - Gracefully exits the loop once data is collected or time runs out

5. **Artifact Retrieval & Cleanup**  
   - Uses RTR‚Äôs **Get File** to fetch the packaged ZIP archive from the remote device  
   - Deletes the temporary working directory and files used during execution  

6. **Slack Notification System**  
   - Sends Slack alerts at key stages:
     - **Run Initiation** ‚Äì who ran the workflow and what inputs were selected  
     - **Exception Alerts** ‚Äì if Hindsight or the preparation step fails  
     - **Completion Report** ‚Äì device name, user email, ZIP filename, and success flag

## üß† Why This Design Works

- **Self-healing reliability** ‚Äì Built-in conditional checks and looping ensure success even on first-time setup or slow endpoints  
- **Zero hardcoding** ‚Äì Paths, formats, and browsers are fully parameterized using workflow variables  
- **Plug-and-play** ‚Äì Can be invoked manually or embedded as a module within broader DFIR playbooks  
- **Operator-aware** ‚Äì All Slack messages include runner identity and device metadata

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Make sure the following are set up prior to execution:

- CrowdStrike Falcon RTR access (with file upload & script execution permissions)  
- A Slack App with a webhook URL and appropriate channel permissions  
- Local copy of `hindsight.exe` (from [obsidianforensics](https://github.com/obsidianforensics/hindsight/releases))

## üîß Trigger Parameters

These inputs define the scope and output of each run:

| Parameter           | Description                                       | Required | Example         |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------|
| `deviceID`         | CrowdStrike Sensor ID                | ‚úÖ       | A1B2C3D4E5F6... |
| `selected_browser` | Target browser (`Google Chrome`, `Microsoft Edge`, `Brave`) | ‚úÖ | Google Chrome   |
| `output_format`    | Output format (`xlsx`, `jsonl`, `sqlite`)         | ‚úÖ       | xlsx            |

## üì¨ Slack Integration

Slack updates are sent via webhook and include:

- üì• **Trigger Summary** ‚Äì Who initiated the workflow and selected parameters  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Notices** ‚Äì Clearly formatted exception output from PowerShell scripts  
- ‚úÖ **Completion Report** ‚Äì Includes device hostname, ZIP filename, and sensor tags
